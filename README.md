# BR-Archive

BR-Archive (BRa) is an educational project to compress files with the `DEFLATE` algorithm and creating self-extracting-archives (SFX)

The Default extension for the archive format is `.BRa`

> The Focus is to creating self-extracting archives.

> The 1st Phase is just an archive of 1 single file due to CLI parsing arguments limitations.

The actual version doesn't implement wildcards input for the files selections, but manually each file must be specified.

This is just the foundations of encoding, decoding and self-extracting archives.

## Self-Extracting Archive

The self extracting archive will be done in the following formats:

### EXE

an `.EXE` SFX will be generated for MS Windows oriented systems.



### ELF

an `.BRx` SFX will be generated for Linux oriented systems.
