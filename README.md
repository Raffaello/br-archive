# BR-Archive

BR-Archive (BRa) is an educational project to compress files with the `DEFLATE` algorithm and creating self-extracting-archives (SFX)

The Default extension for the archive format is `.BRa`

> The Focus is to creating self-extracting archives.

> The 1st Phase is just an archive of 1 single file due to CLI parsing arguments limitations.

the current version implements only a single file archive to set up the foundations of
encoding, decoding and self-extracting.

## Self-Extracting Archive

The self extracting archive will be done in the following formats:

### EXE

an `.EXE` SFX will be generated for MS Windows oriented systems.



### ELF

an `.BRx` SFX will be generated for Linux oriented systems.
