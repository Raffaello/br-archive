# BR-Archive

BR-Archive (BRa) is an educational project to compress files with the `DEFLATE` algorithm and creating self-extracting-archives (SFX)

The Default extension for the archive format is `.BRa`

This version doesn't support wildcard inputs for file selection; each file must be specified explicitly.
This lays the foundation for encoding, decoding, and self-extracting archives.

## Self-Extracting Archive

The self extracting archive will be done in the following formats:

### PE/EXE

an `.EXE` SFX will be generated for MS Windows oriented systems.

### ELF

an `.BRx` SFX will be generated for Linux oriented systems.
