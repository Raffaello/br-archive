/**
 * @brief Encode data using Move-to-Front (MTF) algorithm.
 *
 * The Move-to-Front algorithm maintains a list of all possible byte values
 * (0-255) and for each input symbol, outputs its current position in the list,
 * then moves that symbol to the front. This creates many small values (0-3)
 * when there's locality in the data, making it highly compressible.
 *
 * Commonly used after BWT to further improve compression ratios.
 *
 * @param buf      Input data buffer to transform
 * @param buf_size Size of input data in bytes (must be > 0)
 * @return         Allocated output buffer with MTF-encoded data, or NULL on failure
 *
 * @note Caller is responsible for freeing the returned buffer.
 * @note Output size is always equal to input size.
 * @note Each output byte represents a position in the MTF table (0-255).
 *
 * @warning Input buffer must not be NULL and buf_size must be > 0.
